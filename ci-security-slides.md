## Survival tips

- New to DevOps? --> Focus on learning GitHub Actions
- Completionists --> Start with answers from `examples` branch
- CTF --> Just don't check the `examples` branch

---slide---

## How the labs work

- Fork the repository: <https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security>
- Read the `/labs/*`
- Make your own solution under `/.github/workflows`
- Check example solutions from <https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security/tree/release/examples>

---slide---

## Lab targets

- 99% of time you are targeting .NET application
- It is `dotnet new mvc` template with some small changes
- Disclaimer: Attack only targets that you have permission for.

## GitHub Actions

- GitHub Actions are based on YAML.
- 2000 minutes free time per month
- Run on "somebody elses VMs"
- Running on Windows / Mac images consumes more time
- Lab00-Lab02: Teaches the syntax GitHub Actions syntax

---slide---

```yaml [1-2|3-6|8-9|11-12]
name: Name shown in github
run-name: Run name shown in github
on: # Starting triggers
  workflow_dispatch: # Click from GitHub support
  pull_request: # After PR is created
  push: # After commit is pushed
jobs:
  Example-Job: # Set of steps that are run on a VM
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # type of vm
    steps:
      - name: Example # name of step
        run: echo "ðŸŽ‰!" # Actually doing the thing
```

## Detect threats

```md [1|2|3|4]
ðŸŸ¢ Detect succesful (good)
ðŸŸ¢ Tool not run (bad)
ðŸ”´ Tool failed (bad)
ðŸ”´ Detected and failed (bad)
```

---note---

If the point is to detect and not prevent, then build failures are soon to be dismissed if they by default always fail.

---slide---

## Prevent threats

```md [1|2|3|4]
ðŸŸ¢ No threats (good)
ðŸ”´ Prevention successful (good)
ðŸ”´ Tool failed (bad)
ðŸŸ¢ Tool not run (bad)
```

---note---

False positive, false negative, true positive, true negative etc.
